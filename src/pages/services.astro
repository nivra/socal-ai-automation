	## Automation that frees your time

	We specialize in **bespoke automation and agentic AI solutions** — custom-built systems that eliminate the repetitive pain eating your time and energy.

	### Bespoke Automation & AI Solutions

	This is where we shine. We understand your specific workflow, identify the friction points, and build systems tailored to your business. Not templates. Not off-the-shelf. *Your* solution.

	**What this looks like:**
	- Custom automation workflows for intake, scheduling, reporting, communication
	- Agentic AI systems that learn your business and work smarter over time
	- Data integration across your tools — making them talk to each other
	- End-to-end implementation support

	We handle the complexity so you can focus on the work that matters.

	### AI/ML Consulting

	Need strategy? We help you think through where AI fits in your operation — what's worth building, what's extractive, what honors your values and your community.

	**What this looks like:**
	- Assessing your current workflows and pain points
	- Designing AI solutions that are ethical and sustainable
	- Building implementation roadmaps
	- Ongoing support for your teams

	### Implementation & Support

	If we build it together, we support it. And if you're running a project in our wheelhouse, we're here.
