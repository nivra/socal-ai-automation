			<h1>Our Services</h1>

			<h2>Automation that frees your time</h2>

			<p>We specialize in <strong>bespoke automation and agentic AI solutions</strong> — custom-built systems that eliminate the repetitive pain eating your time and energy.</p>

			<h3>Bespoke Automation &amp; AI Solutions</h3>

			<p>This is where we shine. We understand your specific workflow, identify the friction points, and build systems tailored to your business. Not templates. Not off-the-shelf. <em>Your</em> solution.</p>

			<p><strong>What this looks like:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Custom automation workflows for intake, scheduling, reporting, communication</li>
				<li>Agentic AI systems that learn your business and work smarter over time</li>
				<li>Data integration across your tools — making them talk to each other</li>
				<li>End-to-end implementation support</li>
			</ul>

			<p>We handle the complexity so you can focus on the work that matters.</p>

			<h3>AI/ML Consulting</h3>

			<p>Need strategy? We help you think through where AI fits in your operation — what's worth building, what's extractive, what honors your values and your community.</p>

			<p><strong>What this looks like:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Assessing your current workflows and pain points</li>
				<li>Designing AI solutions that are ethical and sustainable</li>
				<li>Building implementation roadmaps</li>
				<li>Ongoing support for your teams</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Implementation &amp; Support</h3>

			<p>If we build it together, we support it. And if you're running a project in our wheelhouse, we're here.</p>
