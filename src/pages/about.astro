			<h1>About Arielle's Parlor</h1>

			<img src={ArielleHeadshot.src} alt="Arielle" class="about-headshot" />

			<p>
				I'm Arielle, an Asian trans femme with 15 years of experience building automation systems,
				AI infrastructure, and data systems. For most of that time, I was making corporations more profitable.
				I was good at it. Really good.
			</p>

			<p>
				But I stopped being okay with that.
			</p>

			<h2>Choosing Sides</h2>

			<p>
				Two years into my transition, I know what it means to be part of a community the system is actively trying
				to eliminate. I know what survival means. I know what resistance looks like.
			</p>

			<p>
				So I'm bringing those 15 years of expertise home — to my community, to the people fighting to survive,
				to the organizations building something different.
			</p>

			<h2>What I Believe</h2>

			<p>
				SoCal AI Automation isn't a business consultant firm. It's infrastructure for resistance. We free you from
				repetitive pain so you can do the work that matters. We build AI systems that honor Earth and community.
			</p>

			<p>
				I've worked with trans-femme fitness collectives, kink educators, community clinics, food networks, and
				organizing groups. I've helped build healing spaces and worked on eco-village projects. These are the
				communities I move in. These are the people I understand. These are the people I'm here to serve.
			</p>

			<h2>The Vision</h2>

			<p>
				In three years, I want SoCal AI Automation to be:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Serving 100+ clients — a mix of QT-owned businesses and resistance organizations</li>
				<li>Employing 10 full-time trans and queer folks with proper wages and benefits</li>
				<li>Deploying hundreds of AI agents that actually work</li>
				<li>Seeing dozens of our clients 2x, 5x, or 10x their impact</li>
				<li>Recognized as a technology leader in resistance spaces</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				But first, we have to pay rent. So let's start with the people doing the work right now,
				in your communities, who are drowning in manual repetitive tasks that are stealing their time.
			</p>

			<h2>Let's Talk</h2>

			<p>
				If you're building something that honors Earth and community, and you need help automating the painful
				repetitive work, let's talk. I offer free 15-minute consultations to see if we're a fit.
