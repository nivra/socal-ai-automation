			<h1>About SoCal AI Automation</h1>

			<p>
				SoCal AI Automation builds bespoke automation and agentic AI solutions for QT-owned businesses
				and organizations committed to survival, empowerment, change, and connection. We're not a
				business consultant firm — we're infrastructure for resistance. We free you from repetitive
				pain so you can do the work that matters.
			</p>

			<p>
				We serve salons, restaurants, shops, nonprofits, mutual aid networks, healing spaces, and
				organizing groups across San Diego, Orange County, and beyond. If you're building something
				that honors Earth and community, we're for you.
			</p>

			<h2>The Vision</h2>

			<p>
				In three years, we want SoCal AI Automation to be:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A community pillar that businesses, groups, and orgs can count on to make their jobs easier</li>
				<li>Recognized as a technology leader in resistance spaces</li>
				<li>Deploying hundreds of ethical AI agents that support our communities</li>
				<li>Employing dozens of full-time trans, queer, and BIPOC folks with proper wages and benefits</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Meet Arielle</h2>

			<img src={ArielleHeadshot.src} alt="Arielle" class="about-headshot" />

			<p>
				I'm Arielle, an Asian trans femme with 15 years of experience building automation systems,
				AI infrastructure, and data systems. For most of that time, I was making corporations more profitable.
				I was good at it. Really good.
			</p>

			<p>
				But I stopped being okay with that.
			</p>

			<p>
				Two years into my transition, I know what it means to be part of a community the system is actively trying
				to eliminate. I know what survival means. I know what resistance looks like.
			</p>

			<p>
				So I'm bringing those 15 years of expertise home — to my community, to the people fighting to survive,
				to the organizations building something different.
			</p>

			<p>
				I've worked with trans-femme fitness collectives, kink educators, community clinics, food networks, and
				organizing groups. I've helped build healing spaces and worked on eco-village projects. These are the
				communities I move in. These are the people I understand. These are the people I'm here to serve.
