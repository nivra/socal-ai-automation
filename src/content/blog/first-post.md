## The world is breaking.

I'm choosing sides.

For 15 years, I built workflow automation systems, AI infrastructure, and data systems that made corporations more profitable. I was good at it. Really good.

But I stopped being okay with that.

I'm Asian trans femme. Two years into my transition, I know what it means to be part of a community the system is actively trying to eliminate. I know what survival means. I know what resistance looks like.

So I'm bringing those 15 years of expertise home — to my community, to the people fighting to survive, to the organizations building something different.

**SoCal AI Automation isn't a business consultant firm.** It's infrastructure for resistance. We free you from repetitive pain so you can do the work that matters. We build AI systems that honor Earth and community.

We serve QT-owned businesses and organizations committed to survival, empowerment, change, and connection.

And we're building to scale: 100+ clients, 10 full-time trans and queer staff, dozens of organizations 2x-10x'd by our work.

**Let's build something different together.**
