## The world is breaking open.

Climate collapse is accelerating. Fascism is rising across the globe. Hate is being codified into law. The colonial capitalist system that built the modern world is shuddering under the weight of its own contradictions — ecological devastation, wealth concentration, the erosion of community, the commodification of everything sacred.

And in the middle of all this, artificial intelligence is arriving.

AI could be the most transformative technology in human history. It could also be the most destructive. The question isn't whether AI will reshape the world — it already is. The question is: **who gets to shape it, and for whose benefit?**

Right now, the answer is clear. AI is being built by corporations, for the rich, to extract more value from people and planet. That's not inevitable. That's a choice. And we're making a different one.

## The Prophecy of the Condor and the Eagle

There is a prophecy shared across Indigenous traditions of the Americas — the prophecy of the Condor and the Eagle. I first encountered it in 2010, while practicing with Ayahuasca ceremonial communities, and it has shaped how I see the world ever since.  Thi

The prophecy says that the Condor owned the skies for thousands of years, but then the Eagle rose, and the Eagle owned the skies for hundreds of years.   But now, we are living in the time when the Condor and the Eagle must learn to fly together.  

There are many interpretations of this prophecy.  This is what we believe.

The Eagle represents the path of the mind — science, technology, industry, the brilliant innovations that have transformed human life. The Eagle soars high and sees far. The Eagle has given us allopathic medicine, modern communication, the ability to connect across oceans. But the Eagle, flying alone, has also brought us to the edge of ecological collapse, to wars fought with weapons that could end everything, to systems that value profit over life.

The Condor represents the path of the heart — Indigenous wisdom, connection to Earth, community, ceremony, the deep knowing that we are not separate from the land or from each other. The Condor has carried this wisdom for millennia, often in the face of genocide and erasure.

 Neither path alone is sufficient. The Eagle without the Condor is brilliant but destructive. The Condor without the Eagle is wise but vulnerable.  Now is the time for the two to learn to fly together.


**We need both.**

## AI for the Village

This is what SoCal AI Automation is about. We are Eagle people learning to fly with the Condor.

We take the most powerful technology of our era — artificial intelligence, automation, the tools that the Eagle built — and we point them toward the values that the Condor carries. Community. Earth. Reciprocity. Dignity. Survival.

We don't build AI to extract. We build AI to support the village.

That means:
- Automation that gives community healers their time back
- AI agents that help organizers coordinate resistance
- Systems that honor the ecological cost of compute
- Technology that serves the people who have always been last in line

We think about where our energy comes from. We think about who benefits. We think about what kind of world we're building with every system we deploy.

## Why this moment matters

The old world is dying. That's not pessimism — it's observation. The systems built on extraction, exploitation, and endless growth cannot sustain themselves. They are already failing.

But something else is being born. In every community garden, every mutual aid network, every healing circle, every queer-owned business that refuses to play by the old rules — something new is growing. It's fragile. It needs support. It needs infrastructure.

That's us. We're building the infrastructure for what comes next.

The ecological crisis isn't separate from the social crisis isn't separate from the technological crisis. They're all the same crisis — a crisis of values, of relationship, of remembering what matters. And the response has to be integrated too.

AI used to benefit the village. Technology in service of community. The Eagle and the Condor, flying together.

**That's why now. Because later might be too late.**
