## We work with people like us.

We serve QT-owned businesses, BIPOC-led organizations, and communities committed to survival, empowerment, change, and connection. Salons, clinics, restaurants, mutual aid networks, healing spaces, educators, organizers — people doing real work in their communities.

We don't serve everyone. We serve the people who are building something that honors Earth and community. If your work is about extraction, exploitation, or maintaining systems of harm, we're not for you. If your values align with the current administration's agenda of hate, we're not for you. Full stop.

That's a deliberate choice.

## Why these communities?

Because these are the communities that need it most and get it least.

Big tech builds automation tools for corporations. Enterprise AI serves enterprise budgets. The people doing the hardest, most important work — the organizers, the healers, the small business owners feeding their neighborhoods — are left to drown in manual processes, spreadsheets, and duct-tape workflows.

They're doing transformative work with insufficient tools. That's not a market gap — it's an injustice.

## Who are these people really?

We want to work with:

- **Services with soul.** Trans-femme fitness and wellness. Kink and rope education. Community clinics. Healing spaces. Places where the work is deeply personal and the admin burden is crushing.
- **Businesses that feed their communities.** Food that matters. Supply chains that honor dignity. Restaurants, shops, and third spaces that are community anchors, not just storefronts.
- **Resistance infrastructure.** Organizing networks. Education. Mutual aid. Community villages. The connective tissue that holds marginalized communities together.

These are the people we understand because these are the communities we move in. We're not outsiders offering charity. We're insiders offering expertise.

## The real reason

Fifteen years of building automation systems for corporations taught us something: the same tools that make a hedge fund 3% more profitable could give a community clinic back 20 hours a week. The same AI that optimizes ad targeting could help an organizer coordinate mutual aid across three counties.

The technology exists. It's just been pointed in the wrong direction.

We're pointing it home.  Back to the village.  Back to the people.
