## We work with people like us.

**QT-owned businesses** with operating budgets. Salons, restaurants, shops, services. Places building something real in their communities.

**Organizations focused on marginalized communities.** Nonprofits doing resistance work. Mutual aid networks. Groups fighting for survival, empowerment, and change.

We're based in San Diego and Orange County right now, expanding to LA County. Eventually, geography won't limit us.

### Our first clients are building:

- **Services with soul.** Trans-femme fitness and wellness. Kink and rope education. Community clinics. Healing spaces.
- **Businesses that feed their communities.** Food that matters. Supply chains that honor dignity.
- **Resistance infrastructure.** Organizing networks. Education. Mutual aid. Community villages.

If you're building something that honors Earth and community, and you're drowning in manual repetitive work that's stealing your time — we're for you.

**Let's talk.**
